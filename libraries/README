CAT - Class(es) to communicate with various HAM rigs (here MK706MkIIG) via the
      vendor specific CAT interface and protocol. Only a subset of the
      possible CAT commands are implemented.

      At present we have:
      - class IcomCAT : communicate with ICom rigs
      - class YaesuCAT : communicate with Yaesu rigs (not yet working)
      - class CATutil : useful functions for the other stuff (not much yet)

Morse - Class(es) to generate Morse code

      Class Morse (currently the base class) contains the Morse code table
      and is able to key a transmitter connected to a configurable pin
      of the uController.

      Class RFM12Morse uses RFM12 modules (not tested with RFM12B) and puts
      them into an OOK mode where (more or less precisely) Morse signs can
      be generated in a similar fashion than with class Morse.

      It turns out that RFM12 modules are far more stable than simple
      433 MHz transmitters for wall plugs.
