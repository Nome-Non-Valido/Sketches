CAT - A class to communicate via an Icom rig (here MK706MkIIG) via the CAT
      protocol. Only a subset of the possible CAT commands are implemented.

Morse - Class(es) to generate Morse code

      Class Morse (currently the base class) contains the Morse code table
      and is able to key a transmitter connected to a configurable pin
      of the uController.

      Class RFM12Morse uses RFM12 modules (not tested with RFM12B) and puts
      them into an OOK mode where (more or less precisely) Morse signs can
      be generated in a similar fashion than with class Morse.

      It turns out that RFM12 modules are far more stable than simple
      433 MHz transmitters for wall plugs.
