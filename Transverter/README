README for my CAT based transverter control project.

Requirements:
--------------

The program requires 2 serial interfaces to communicate with both rigs and
a third one for debugging purposes. As the SoftwareSerial class cannot listen
in the background to the messages coming from any of the rigs, an Arduino
like platform which supports 2 (3) hardware serial ports is required.

The following additional libraries (besides our CAT library) are reqired:
- LCM1602 I2C-LCD with PCF8574 I2C extender chip,
  http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/LCDi2c
- Streaming, at least for debug purposes
  http://arduiniana.org/libraries/streaming/
- a library for the rotary encoder
