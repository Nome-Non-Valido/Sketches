About

The Sketches repository contains a collection of my sketches for the Arduino, Teensy
and ESP8266 platform.

Each directory contains its corresponding README file which describes the
specific requirements etc.

In order not to conflict with other license models, third party libraries are not
included into these projects but links to them (for downloading) are be provided.
For some third party libraries patch instructions are given, if applicable.
